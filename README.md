Tamedo_AjaxCart
===============

Here is a simple Ajax shopping cart module for Magento. 
The module allows your customers to add products to the shopping cart without the annoying page refresh. 
When a product is added the mini cart on the sidebar is updated and the minicart top link scrolls down to show items added to the shopping cart. 
If you find this module useful and I have saved some time feel free to buy me a coffee using my Onename below - 
Enjoy!
